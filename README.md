# Forkify – a Website to Find and Manage Recipes

## Description

In this project, while following along with the excellent _The Complete JavaScript Course 2022_ [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course), I built an app called _forkify_.

## Features

- Search for recipes
- Adjust servings for any recipe
- Bookmark recipes
- Add your own recipes

<!-- A live version can be accessed [here](https://rliess-forkify.netlify.app/). -->

The original course website can be found at <https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/>.

## Installation

- ⚠️ A production build can't be currently created because of a [parcel bug](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/8257) with versions 2.6.1/2.6.2.
- Download or clone from Github
- Get an API key for the forkify API [here](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2)
- Copy `apikey.js` from `./install` to `./src/js/` and add your API key
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` to start the development server. The website can then be accessed locally by pointing the web browser to  `localhost:1234`
